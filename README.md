Project for Algorithms &amp; Complexity class

Task 1 "ordnung must sein"
a) Implement: bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort. Test and compare their running times
   for a number of small (ca. 5-50) and large input sizes. Carefully choose (or even average) appropriate
   inputs to make sure you are justifying the right conclusion. Include a graph with results of your
   measurements for all algorithms, e.g. running time as a function of array size.
b) The Olsen Gang has obtained a file with a huuuge number of credit card details. However, before they can sell the data
   for big money they must match them with carholder names in a separate file. To do that the data has to be stably sorted by PIN. Choose a linear time algortihm for the job.
   Empirically investigate at what data volume the linear solution gains supremacy.
